C# Project OOP

This is a TAFE project from September 2018

## Unit name:
Apply introductory object-oriented language skills

### Author:
Trevor Garrity


### Created in:
Jetbrains Rider IDE

### Version:
1.0
  
### About:

A savage new dystopian TV show that pitches celebrities against each other in brutal knife combat led us to
create an application that can predict the outcome of the battles.
Celebrities are given random weapons and are made to fight in random arenas.
Winners are selected upon initial strengths and weaknesses with variables from random weapons and arenas taken into account
There are also professional fighters added to the mix who contain their own properties such as the ability to reduce their opponents
eye of the tiger, often through a pre-match cold hard stare.
                  
### TO DO: 
Validation of input, break up to smaller methods, create method for user built Celebrities.


### Unit requirements: 

    1. Submit a program that operates as per the scenario provided.  The program must:
        a. correctly use programming language syntax
        b. use data types appropriately
        c. demonstrate use of modules (or methods) to achieve the outcome
        d. use array algorithms
        e. correctly use sequence, selection and iteration (looping)
    2. The program must also: 
        a. create a simple Item class structure with members
        b. include the properties described within the appropriate classes
        c. create suitable objects as instances of these classes
        d. show inheritance by the subclasses   
        e. use composition as  a match is composed of 2 or more  celebrities.
        f. overload the method for a  parent class with one for a subclass   
            i. ensure it has a different signature
              (example here might be a weapon that inherits from the blade class)
        g. make use of other suitable methods as necessary.
        h. The read and write text files must be correctly used and created. Perhaps you could read the celebrity details from a file then instantiate them. 
           Write the battle outcome to a file.
        i. the program needs to complete successfully
        
    3.  Provide a test process overview supported by:
        a. at least one (1) screenshot showing results of testing of battles,
        b. at least one (1) reference to documentation relevant to coding or debugging in the language used (e.g. in Harvard Style),
           at least one (1) screenshot showing use of a debugging tool during testing
